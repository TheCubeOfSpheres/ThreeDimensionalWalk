--How to animate and control characters with class based Finite State Machine--

---Basic Character Controler Class---
!Initialization----
Constructed with params = obj(camera and the scene) --- 'For access to scene and camera'
Acceleration, dececeleration and velocity --- control characeter speed
animations object -- available animations for character
instance of BasicCharacterController Input --- keyboard/mouse controls
Instance of CharacterFSM which extend FiniteStateMachine Class --- Statemachine for character
	The FSM takes an proxy of BasicCharacterControllerClass with (this.animations) passed in
runs its class function __LoadModels();

!Add ThirdPerson camera customization (Mouse wheel in and out to zoom, and button to reset);
!Integrate start and stop walk animations into controller;

!Procedurally generate a world to explore and then add collision gravity and exploration interactions (falling, climbing, sprinting, landing, )
